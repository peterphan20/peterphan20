## About Me
My name is **Peter**, and I am a web developer currently living in Houston, TX. üöÄ

I recently jumped over to web developing after pursuing a career in nursing.
Some of the things I enjoy doing outside of coding are weightlifting and video games.
I am learning all that I can in hopes of mastering the art of developing full stack applications üëç
