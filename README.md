## About Me
My name is **Peter**, and I am a web developer currently living in Houston, TX. :metal:

I recently jumped over to web developing after pursuing a career in nursing.
Outside of coding I just started weightlifting and I am enjoying every bit of it. I love learning new things. 
I believe it is very important to try and learn something new every day!
